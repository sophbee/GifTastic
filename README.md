# GifTastic

This project highlighted the use of the Giphy API. I didn't use Bootstrap this time and edited my own CSS stylesheet. Again, I used jQuery to manipulate the DOM for creating new buttons when new animals were added. Along with new buttons, I had to use AJAX to call on the JSON elements from the API to generate still gifs when an animal name is clicked on. Then, if the user clicks on the gif itself, the animated gif played through until the user clicked again to stop it.
